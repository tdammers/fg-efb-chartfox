ChartFox Login App for FG-EFB
=============================

This is an app for the FlightGear EFB that adds ChartFox login functionality.

It is provided separately from the main EFB code and any aircraft models in
order to avoid licensing conflicts between the proprietary ChartFox branding
and the Free Software licenses under which most FG aircraft are released.

Installing
----------

Copy the `chartfox` subdirectory into `Export/efbapps/chartfox` below your FG
home directory. On Unix-like systems, this should be
`~/.fgfs/Export/efbapps/chartfox`. For Linux users, the provided installer
script (`install.sh`) will create the necessary directories and copy the files
for you.

Requirements
------------

In order to use this software, you will need:

- A FlightGear aircraft that includes fg-efb (such as the E-Jet family).
- [`fg-efb-server`](https://github.com/tdammers/fg-efb-server/) running locally
  and configured for fg-efb
- A VATSIM account (required for logging into ChartFox).
- Phi (included in FlightGear) on port 10000 (start FlightGear with the
  option `--httpd=10000`)

Usage
-----

Load up an aircraft that includes fg-efb (such as the E-Jet family).

Make sure fg-efb-server is running.

In the EFB, open the Chartfox app and click the blue "Log In" button. A VATSIM
login prompt may show up in your web browser; if so, confirm to log into
Chartfox.

After a successful login, you can access Chartfox charts via the Charts app in
the EFB.
